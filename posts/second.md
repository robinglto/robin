Routing in Next.js is handled with the next/router library. This library provides a number of functions and objects that allow us to navigate between different pages in our application, as well as get information about the current route.

One of the most useful functions in next/router is useRouter. This function allows us to access the router object in any component of our application, which enables us to get information about the current route, such as the pathname, route parameters, and navigation state.

To use useRouter, we first need to import it in our component:

```ts
import { useRouter } from "next/router";
```

Then, we can use it in our component like this:

```ts
const router = useRouter();
console.log(router.pathname);
```

With router.pathname you can check the current pathname of the page, this is useful when you want to check if the user is in a specific page.

In addition to useRouter, next/router also provides other useful functions such as push, replace, and back, which allow us to navigate between pages in our application programmatically.

```ts
router.push("/about");
router.replace("/about");
router.back();
```

In conclusion, next/router is an excellent tool for handling routing in Next.js and its use is essential for creating dynamic and highly interactive web applications. With useRouter we can get information about the current route, and with the navigation functions, we can move through our application programmatically.

I hope this information helps you better understand how routing works in Next.js and how to use it to create more powerful and engaging web applications for users.
